# mesh_to_stl
Convert Abaqus .inp file  to 3D printing stl file. 
Also you can fix it for converting other mesh format file into STL file.   

### How to use 

To use this, use `inp_to_stl` under the `script` folder, just fix the input filename and output file name and run the script. 

### Other notes 

ðŸ˜„I never use Abaqus, So this script is written for my colleagues to use for converting.
